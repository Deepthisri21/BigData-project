The following report analyzes the MovieLens 20M dataset in-depth to develop a feature-rich recommendation system, leveraging collaborative filtering and matrix factorization with feature engineering in PySpark. The present study investigates user behavior, various patterns in rating movies, and metadata to improve prediction accuracy. We show how integrating user and item features, e.g., genres and tags-and tuning of important hyperparameters contribute toward solving open issues such as the cold-start problem. Our results show that feature engineering greatly enhances the performance and personalization of recommendations, having important implications for scalable recommendation systems on various streaming and e-commerce platforms.
